# XHR
XMLHttpRequest API 
Objective
Demonstrate your understanding of XMLHttpRequest (XHR) in web development by completing tasks of increasing
complexity. Showcase your ability to integrate XHR with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.

###Level 1 (L1) - Basic XHR Implementation

- Create a simple webpage using HTML and CSS that uses XHR to fetch and display a list of posts from 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts'.
- Display the title of each post.
- Ensure proper error handling for the XHR request.
- Style the page minimally with CSS.
###Level 2 (L2) - Interactive Application with XHR
- Enhance your application from L1. Allow users to add a new post using a form. Send the data to 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts' using XHR POST request.
- Implement a form with fields for the title and body of the post.
- On form submission, send a POST request using XHR and show a success message.
- Implement client-side form validation before sending the request.
- Style the form and the success message.
###Level 3 (L3) - Integrating XHR with React
- Convert your application from L2 into a React application. Manage the state using React hooks and update the UI based on fetch status (loading, success, error).
- Implement the application in React, breaking it into components.
- Use React hooks (e.g., useState, useEffect) to manage the state and the XHR requests.
- Display a loading indicator while fetching data.
- Implement error handling and show error messages if the fetch fails.
- Ensure the UI is responsive and user-friendly.
Submission Guidelines
Submit your code in a ZIP file containing all the necessary files to run the application.
Include a [README.md](http://readme.md/) file with instructions on how to set up and run your project.

Ensure your code is well-commented and follows best practices for readability and maintainability.
